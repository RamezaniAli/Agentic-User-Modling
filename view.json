I loved the magical realism woven into Josey's story, and the Southern charm added a lovely backdrop. The characters felt real and relatable, and I found myself laughing and tearing up in equal measure. The narration was top-notch, making it an even more enjoyable experience. A sweet treat of a book that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend!",

They are now \"adults\", but their behaviour doesn't reflect it. The entire family seems to be perched on the precipice of a mental breakdown of epic proportion. Interwoven with intense dissatisfaction with their lives, political reference that I fear only a Canadian would understand, and bizarre appearances by neighbourhood cats that I can't quite figure out, the writing is gritty and edgy but contains a level of metaphor that goes beyond my ability or desire to figure out.",

As it is, the audiobook reduced some of the back and forth in time confusion, by implementing separate narrators in the different time sequences.The premise of the story, two lovers travelling in time, being reborn and passing each other, sometimes connecting and sometimes not, was a tantalizing one. The idea of repeated reincarnation and reconnecting with people we have loved before, in order to right the wrongs we have done one another, is certainly very compelling. Overall, a pleasing listen even though, by the end, I just wanted them to \"get on with it.\" Good writing, but the story became a little weighted down and monotonous after passing through 1500 years from start to finish.",
