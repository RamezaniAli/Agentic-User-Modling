    "user_information": "This reader has little patience for self-absorbed protagonists and shallow stories, especially when they are presented as feminist. She is unimpressed by autobiographical fiction that she perceives as stagnant and selfish, and clearly dislikes the term \"feminazi.\" Although she once tried to embrace certain feminist works, she now finds them cautionary tales of affluence and navel-gazing. If a book doesn't immediately grab her attention, she's quick to abandon it.",

    "true_review": "This 'was' one of the 'important feminist works' of the early 70s. Fighting to 'over throw' the double standard, refusing to be subjugated into marriage, and having numerous shallow sexual encounters are all covered adnauseam in this 'biographical' account. It does not conclude with a happy ending. I, of course, read this when it was first published and I tried to like it since I was a 'part-time feminazi' myself. It is a cautionary tale and pathological study of affluence, belly button gazing and disaffected young women.",
