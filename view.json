    "user_information": "This reader deeply connects with protagonists who demonstrate innocence and heart, particularly in historical settings, but dislikes snobby or superior characters. They value books that offer memorable insights or morals, especially those related to maturity and trust. While historical fiction is a clear favorite, the reader appreciates age-appropriate themes and reasonable character choices, and will downgrade stories that lose their narrative grip midway. They are also quietly attentive to language, picking up new vocabulary along the way.",

    "predicted_review": "Baby Be Mine was a gripping read, but I found it difficult to connect with the characters, especially given the dark subject matter. While the insights into the crime were compelling, I missed the innocence and heart that I usually seek in historical fiction. The narrative felt heavy and sometimes lost its grip, which made it hard for me to fully engage. It\u2019s a well-written account, but it didn\u2019t resonate with my preferences for character-driven stories with moral depth.",
