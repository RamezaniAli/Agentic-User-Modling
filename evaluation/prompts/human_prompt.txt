You are given two anonymous reviews about the same book, along with a short book description. Your task is to assess how similar the two reviews are across three dimensions. Be generous and flexible — you don’t need exact matches. Focus on overall impressions and emotional tone.

Evaluate each of the following:

1. **Relevance**  
Do both reviews talk about the book in a generally similar way? Even if they mention different details, do they reflect similar areas of focus or overall impressions?

2. **Sentiment**  
Do both reviews express a similar overall opinion about the book (positive, neutral, or negative)? Minor differences are fine — just ensure the overall tone matches.

3. **Emotion**  
Identify the dominant emotion in each review from the following list:
- Joy / Excitement  
- Sadness / Disappointment  
- Anger / Frustration  
- Surprise  
- Calm / Neutral

Then, based on the **emotional distance** between the two, assign a score from 1 to 5:
- 5 = Same emotion  
- 4 = Similar / adjacent emotions  
- 3 = Different, but not opposite  
- 2 = Opposing emotional tones  
- 1 = Completely mismatched or conflicting emotions

Respond with a **valid JSON object** with three keys:

```json
{{
  "relevance": <1-5>,
  "sentiment": <1-5>,
  "emotion": <1-5>
}}
```
