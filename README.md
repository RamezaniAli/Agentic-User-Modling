# 🧠 Agentic User Modeling for Personalized Recommender Systems  

> **Dynamic, human-aligned user modeling using LLM-powered agents**

---

## 🌟 Overview

Personalized recommender systems often represent users as **static vectors**, overlooking the fact that **human preferences evolve over time** and are richly expressed through language — particularly in the **reviews users write**.

In this project, we introduce **Agentic User Modeling**, where each user is represented by a **generative agent powered by a Large Language Model (LLM)**.  
This agent **learns** from a user’s historical **reviews** (text + ratings) to perform two key tasks:

- 🔮 **Rating Prediction** – Predict the rating a user would assign to a new item.  
- ✍️ **Review Generation** – Generate a review that matches the user's **distinctive writing style**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Adaptation:**  
  User preferences **evolve** over time, and our model continuously adapts to reflect these changes.

- **Human-Aligned Representation:**  
  Moving beyond static vectors, this approach captures **rich, nuanced user behavior** through natural language.

- **Two-in-One Task:**  
  Combines both **predictive modeling** and **generative text modeling** for more **comprehensive personalization**.

- **Practical Applications:**  
  - Simulate **"what-if" scenarios** for platforms like Yelp or Amazon.  
  - **Bootstrap cold-start user profiles** in new systems.  
  - Preview user reactions to **new products or services**.

## 🧩 How It Works

Our method synthesizes research in **memory-augmented LLMs** and **retrieval-augmented reasoning**, enabling **controllable, personalized text generation**.
